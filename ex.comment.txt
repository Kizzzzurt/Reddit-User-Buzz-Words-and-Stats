2. But he donated $1million of his own money....

How much have people in this thread donated? How many people in this thread helped clean up the community instead of bitching on Reddit....

Besides, Trump couldn't do it. The secret service wouldn't allow it to happen for an extended amount of time. For obvious security reasons

3. $92 million wasted on this piece of shit. Wonder what that money could have gone to instead and provided a better return for the people in this state. Fuck Trump.

6. Not really. For some people prison is a vacation. Free food. Free healthcare. Free room. And probably has white supremacists to protect him

People like this guy will never feel any guilt. 

Kill him and use the cell on someone else.

8. Not if you talk to Trump. According to him no president has done as much in the same time period as him.
