3. I don't get the point in these videos at all. I have gone through a lot of these checkpoints and my life is no fucking different. i don't feel less free lol. I pull up. Answer the question and within 3 seconds im out of there. These assholes hold up the line refusing to say anything. several minutes go by while there are cars waiting behind this guy especially if he refuses to move to the side for further questioning. Just answer the fucking question and move on with your life. These checkpoints are constitutional so get over it - http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/428/543/case.html

7. If a cop had shot him, /r/news would be up in arms about it and whining about police brutality.

8. Not what I wrote or even implied. I am looking at their subscriber count and wonder why nothing has happened until now? The parents were easily motivated to continue by the amount of views they were getting. If people reported them earlier about what they were doing and refused to view the videos, this would have stopped a long time ago. People should hold each other to higher standards when it comes to child abuse.

17. Considering the small amount of videos you see of police brutality compared to the over 1 million employed cops in the country the fear you are implying is unwarranted. People just decide to listen to the media and nothing else.

20. uhmmmm ok, then explain how Chris Bosh can hit 86%, Kevin Garnett can hit 80%, Tyson Chandler can hit 80%, Greg Monroe can hit 70% and they are all taller than Dwight. Dwight could actually shoot....67% during his rookie season. He is a just a lazy fuck with terrible shooting form.

And a real competitor wouldn't let some stupid mascot win. Fuck Dwight.

23. > it's just that when a pitbull bites you, it usually hurts the most.  

A big reason why people say that you can't blame the owner 100%. It is the breed.
